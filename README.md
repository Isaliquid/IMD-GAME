# IMD-GAME
So, let's break down the filing system for this project.  IMD stands for International Meatball Day, the working title. 

Then, add for what asset the file is for, for example   IMD_GUI,  for Graphical User Interface
(this will also probably need a component. so IMD_GUI_TEXT-v1) 

Finally add a version number, so  IMD_GUI-v1

and there you go, you've made a file. 
Then put the latest version in the folder, and move the older version to its own little spot.
(btw, to make a folder, just had a "/" at the end of a file name

have fun
